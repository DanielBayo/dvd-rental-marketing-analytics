# DVD Rental Marketing Analytics: Data Join

## Joining Tables

Now that weâ€™ve done with the data exploration part of the joining journey - I will start to join all the data table for getting insights for our campaign objective as the query below:

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS complete_joint_dataset;
CREATE TEMP TABLE complete_joint_dataset AS
SELECT
  rental.customer_id,
  inventory.film_id,
  film.title,
  film_category.category_id,
  category.name AS category_name
FROM dvd_rentals.rental
INNER JOIN dvd_rentals.inventory
  ON rental.inventory_id = inventory.inventory_id
INNER JOIN dvd_rentals.film
  ON inventory.film_id = film.film_id
INNER JOIN dvd_rentals.film_category
  ON film.film_id = film_category.film_id
INNER JOIN dvd_rentals.category
  ON film_category.category_id = category.category_id;

SELECT * FROM complete_joint_dataset limit 10;
```

|customer_id|film_id|title          |category_id|category_name|
|-----------|-------|---------------|-----------|-------------|
|130        |80     |BLANKET BEVERLY|8          |Family       |
|459        |333    |FREAKY POCUS   |12         |Music        |
|408        |373    |GRADUATE LORD  |3          |Children     |
|333        |535    |LOVE SUICIDES  |11         |Horror       |
|222        |450    |IDOLS SNATCHERS|3          |Children     |
|549        |613    |MYSTIC TRUMAN  |5          |Comedy       |
|269        |870    |SWARM GOLD     |11         |Horror       |
|239        |510    |LAWLESS VISION |2          |Animation    |
|126        |565    |MATRIX SNOWMAN |9          |Foreign      |
|399        |396    |HANGING DEEP   |7          |Drama        |

## Dealing With Ties

In order to avoid matching **```rental_count```** values, which often refered as "ties", in the same top category ranking, it is neccessary to include 1 more column into our joint dataset as an additional condition for ties dealing.

In this case study, I will use the latest **```rental date```** as a additional determination if there is any tie that happened in our analysis.

To add on this column to my previous joint table, I simply generated the following query as replacement:
```sql
--create complete joint dataset with additional "rental_date" column
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS complete_joint_dataset_with_rental_date;
CREATE TEMP TABLE complete_joint_dataset_with_rental_date AS
SELECT
  rental.customer_id,
  inventory.film_id,
  film.title,
  category.name AS category_name,
  rental.rental_date
FROM dvd_rentals.rental
INNER JOIN dvd_rentals.inventory
  ON rental.inventory_id = inventory.inventory_id
INNER JOIN dvd_rentals.film
  ON inventory.film_id = film.film_id
INNER JOIN dvd_rentals.film_category
  ON film.film_id = film_category.film_id
INNER JOIN dvd_rentals.category
  ON film_category.category_id = category.category_id

--perform group by aggregations on category_name and customer_id
SELECT
  customer_id,
  category_name,
  COUNT(*) AS rental_count,
  MAX(rental_date) AS latest_rental_date
FROM complete_joint_dataset_with_rental_date
GROUP BY 
  customer_id,
  category_name
ORDER BY
  customer_id,
  rental_count DESC,
  latest_rental_date DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
|customer_id|category_name|rental_count|latest_rental_date      |
|-----------|-------------|------------|------------------------|
