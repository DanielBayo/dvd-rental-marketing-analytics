# üìÇ Data Overview
## Data Exploration
In this project, I have a total of 7 tables in our ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram), highlighting the important columns which I should use to join my tables for the data analysis task. 

Therefore, the first section will cover the data inspection process of these tables in order to find out the best JOIN type that will be the most suitable for the later problem solving stage.

## Data Join

Now that I‚Äôve identified the key columns and highlighted some things I need to keep in mind when performing some table joins for my data analysis - next exciting step is to join them together.

# üöÄ Solutions
> Finally, after I‚Äôve combined all of different datasets together into a single base table which I can use for our insights, this section will aim to cover those core calculated fields which I broke down in the first [Key Business Requirements](#Key-Business-Requirements) section of this case study.
