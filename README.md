# Data Overview
## **Data Exploration**
> In this project, we have a total of 7 tables in our ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram), highlighting the important columns which we should use to join our tables for our data analysis task. 
> 
> Therefore, the first section will cover the data inspection process of these tables in order to find out the best JOIN type that will be the most suitable for the later problem solving stage.
